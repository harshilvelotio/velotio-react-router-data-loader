# Velotio React Templates - React Router Data Loading

This example uses Vite.js as a scaffolding and bundling tool and use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to maintain runtime compatibility

## Some stuff to pay attention to
- This example is to demonstrate how to use the data loading capabilities of the new React Router V6
- React Router V6 onwards a slight directory based routing is followed which means routes must be defined inside `src/routes/root.tsx` file
- This example is what we think would be the best way to implement a quick data loading setup - feel free to clone and create PRs for refactoring

## Steps to run
1. Clone the repo
2. `nvm use`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn dev`
