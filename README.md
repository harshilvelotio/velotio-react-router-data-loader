# Velotio React Templates - React Router Data Loading

- This example uses Vite.js as a scaffolding and bundling tool and use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to maintain runtime compatibility
- You can view the end demo [here](https://velotio-react-router-data-loader-2v129ul92-harshilvelotio.vercel.app/)

## Stack
- React Router V6
- TailwindCSS
- Vite.js
## Some stuff to pay attention to
- This example is to demonstrate how to use the data loading capabilities of the new React Router V6
- React Router V6 onwards a slight directory based routing is followed which means routes must be defined inside `src/routes/root.tsx` file
- This example is what we think would be the best way to implement a quick data loading setup - feel free to clone and create PRs for refactoring
- The example also has an implementation of how to add auth protected routes with a dummy auth provider
- You can preview the production build of the app using `yarn preview` (just to see how crazy fast Vite builds are)
